The node subscribes to\n     the Gazebo bumper topics of the SDH. It transforms the Gazebo feedback to\n     the \"tactile_data\" topic to provide the same tactile sensor interface as\n     the schunk_sdh package.\n\n     The following parameters can be set:\n     * cells_x: The number of patches on the tactile sensor in the direction\n                perpendicular to the finger. Defaults to 6.\n     * cells_y: The number of patches on the tactile sensor along the direction\n                of the finger. Defaults to 14.\n     * output_range: The maximum output value of one patch. Defaults to 3500.\n     * sensitivity: The change of output in one patch per Newton. Defaults to\n                    350. The sensitivity can be approximated by the following\n                    formula: S = output_range / (measurement_range * cell_area)\n                    - The measurement range of the tactile pads is 250 kPa (from\n                      the data sheet).\n                    - The output range can be determined by experiment from the\n                      real SDH. It is about 3500.\n                    - The cell area is the size of one patch. Length and width\n                      of the area are determined by dividing the length/width\n                      of the collision surface by the number of cells in the\n                      respective direction.\n                      Important: In most cases this is NOT the cell area that is\n                                 given in the data sheet!\n     * filter_length: The length of the moving average filter which smoothes\n                      the values from simulation. Defaults to 10.\n\n     The node subscribes to the following topics to receive data from the\n     simulation:\n     * thumb_2/state\n     * thumb_3/state\n     * finger_12/state\n     * finger_13/state\n     * finger_22/state\n     * finger_23/state\n\n     The node publishes the processed data on the following topic:\n     * tactile_data\n\n     The simulated bumper must obtain the collision data in the link that the\n     sensor is attached to. This is achieved by setting the \"frameName\" property\n     in the gazebo_ros_bumper controller.","maintainers":"Bruno Brito","authors":"Sven Schneider","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-ipa320-schunk_modular_robotics","readme":""},{"id":6954,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/schunk_svh_driver/github-fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik-schunk_svh_driver#indigo","last_commit_time":"2017-12-14","tags":"schunk svh driver","name":"schunk_svh_driver","repo_name":"schunk_svh_driver","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.2.0","description":"SVH Driver wrapper to enable control of the Schunk five finger hand","maintainers":"Georg Heppner","authors":"Georg Heppner","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik-schunk_svh_driver","readme":""},{"id":6957,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/screenrun/github-dornhege-screenrun#indigo","last_commit_time":"2015-11-16","tags":"screenrun","name":"screenrun","repo_name":"screenrun","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"1.0.2","description":"\n      screenrun is a small tool that pushes commands into a screen window.\n      Use \\015 after a command for ENTER, i.e. executing it.\n  ","maintainers":"Christian Dornhege","authors":"Christian Dornhege","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-dornhege-screenrun","readme":""},{"id":6980,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/segbot/github-utexas-bwi-segbot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-03-09","tags":"segbot","name":"segbot","repo_name":"segbot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.5","description":"\n    ROS packages for controlling Segway-based robots at the Learning Agents\n    Research Group (LARG), AI Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, \n    University of Texas at Austin.\n  ","maintainers":"Piyush Khandelwal Jack O'Quin","authors":"Piyush Khandelwal","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-utexas-bwi-segbot","readme":""},{"id":6981,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/segbot_bringup/github-utexas-bwi-segbot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-03-09","tags":"segbot bringup","name":"segbot_bringup","repo_name":"segbot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.5","description":"\n    Contains launch files and runtime scripts necessary for running\n    segbots in simulation and in the real world.\n  ","maintainers":"Piyush Khandelwal Jack O'Quin","authors":"Piyush Khandelwal","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-utexas-bwi-segbot","readme":""},{"id":6982,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/segbot_description/github-utexas-bwi-segbot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-03-09","tags":"segbot description","name":"segbot_description","repo_name":"segbot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.5","description":"\n    Contains URDF descriptions of all robot components and sensors for the\n    segbot, as well as all the different sensor configurations for a segbot.\n  ","maintainers":"Piyush Khandelwal Jack O'Quin","authors":"Piyush Khandelwal","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-utexas-bwi-segbot","readme":""},{"id":6983,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/segbot_firmware/github-utexas-bwi-segbot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-03-09","tags":"segbot firmware","name":"segbot_firmware","repo_name":"segbot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.5","description":"\n    Arduino firmware for BWI segbot sensor array.\n  ","maintainers":"Jack O'Quin Piyush Khandelwal","authors":"Jose Bigio Jack O'Quin Tim Eckel (NewPing library)","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-utexas-bwi-segbot","readme":""},{"id":6984,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/segbot_gazebo/github-utexas-bwi-segbot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-03-09","tags":"segbot gazebo","name":"segbot_gazebo","repo_name":"segbot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.5","description":"bwi_gazebo","maintainers":"Piyush Khandelwal Jack O'Quin","authors":"Piyush Khandelwal","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-utexas-bwi-segbot","readme":""},{"id":6985,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/segbot_gui/github-utexas-bwi-segbot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-03-09","tags":"segbot gui","name":"segbot_gui","repo_name":"segbot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.5","description":"\n    Displays a simple GUI to the user.
