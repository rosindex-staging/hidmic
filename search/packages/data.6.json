The node subscribes to\n     the Gazebo bumper topics of the SDH. It transforms the Gazebo feedback to\n     the \"tactile_data\" topic to provide the same tactile sensor interface as\n     the schunk_sdh package.\n\n     The following parameters can be set:\n     * cells_x: The number of patches on the tactile sensor in the direction\n                perpendicular to the finger. Defaults to 6.\n     * cells_y: The number of patches on the tactile sensor along the direction\n                of the finger. Defaults to 14.\n     * output_range: The maximum output value of one patch. Defaults to 3500.\n     * sensitivity: The change of output in one patch per Newton. Defaults to\n                    350. The sensitivity can be approximated by the following\n                    formula: S = output_range / (measurement_range * cell_area)\n                    - The measurement range of the tactile pads is 250 kPa (from\n                      the data sheet).\n                    - The output range can be determined by experiment from the\n                      real SDH. It is about 3500.\n                    - The cell area is the size of one patch. Length and width\n                      of the area are determined by dividing the length/width\n                      of the collision surface by the number of cells in the\n                      respective direction.\n                      Important: In most cases this is NOT the cell area that is\n                                 given in the data sheet!\n     * filter_length: The length of the moving average filter which smoothes\n                      the values from simulation. Defaults to 10.\n\n     The node subscribes to the following topics to receive data from the\n     simulation:\n     * thumb_2/state\n     * thumb_3/state\n     * finger_12/state\n     * finger_13/state\n     * finger_22/state\n     * finger_23/state\n\n     The node publishes the processed data on the following topic:\n     * tactile_data\n\n     The simulated bumper must obtain the collision data in the link that the\n     sensor is attached to. This is achieved by setting the \"frameName\" property\n     in the gazebo_ros_bumper controller.","maintainers":"Bruno Brito","authors":"Sven
