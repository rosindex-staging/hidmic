The package implements a ROS node that uses\n    Bluetooth to communicate with the Wiimote device, obtaining accelerometer\n    and gyro data, the state of LEDs, the IR camera, rumble (vibrator),\n    buttons, joystick, and battery state. The node additionally enables ROS\n    nodes to control the Wiimote's LEDs and vibration for feedback to the human\n    Wiimote operator. LEDs and vibration may be switched on and off, or made to\n    operate according to a timed pattern.\n  ","maintainers":"Jonathan Bohren","authors":"Andreas Paepcke Melonee Wise Mark Horn","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-ros-drivers-joystick_drivers","readme":""},{"id":2841,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/assimp_devel/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#melodic","last_commit_time":"2019-05-23","tags":"assimp devel","name":"assimp_devel","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"assimp library","maintainers":"Kei Okada","authors":"","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2842,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/downward/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#melodic","last_commit_time":"2019-05-23","tags":"downward","name":"downward","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"fast downward: PDDL Planner (http://www.fast-downward.org)","maintainers":"Yohei Kakiuchi","authors":"","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2843,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/ff/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#melodic","last_commit_time":"2019-05-23","tags":"ff","name":"ff","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"ff: pddl planner. see http://www.loria.fr/~hoffmanj/ff.html","maintainers":"Kei Okada","authors":"J.Hoffmann","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2844,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/ffha/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#melodic","last_commit_time":"2019-05-23","tags":"ffha","name":"ffha","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"ffha: PDDL Planner (http://ipc.informatik.uni-freiburg.de)","maintainers":"Yohei Kakiuchi","authors":"","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2845,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/julius/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#melodic","last_commit_time":"2019-05-23","tags":"julius","name":"julius","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"julius: Open-Source Large Vocabulary CSR Engine (http://julius.sourceforge.jp/index.php)","maintainers":"Kei Okada","authors":"","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2846,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/libcmt/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#melodic","last_commit_time":"2019-05-23","tags":"libcmt","name":"libcmt","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"libCMT ROS Wrapper","maintainers":"Yuto Inagaki","authors":"","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2847,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/libsiftfast/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#melodic","last_commit_time":"2019-05-23","tags":"libsiftfast","name":"libsiftfast","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"\n    Library to compute SIFT features\n  ","maintainers":"Kei Okada","authors":"zerofrog","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2848,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/lpg_planner/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#melodic","last_commit_time":"2019-05-23","tags":"lpg planner","name":"lpg_planner","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"lpg_planner: LPGL Planner (http://zeus.ing.unibs.it/lpg/)","maintainers":"Hitoshi Kamada","authors":"Kei Okada Yuki Furuta Hitoshi Kamada","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2849,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/mini_maxwell/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#melodic","last_commit_time":"2019-05-23","tags":"mini maxwell","name":"mini_maxwell","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"\n\n     mini_maxwell\n\n  ","maintainers":"Ryohei Ueda","authors":"Yusuke Furuta","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2850,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/nlopt/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#melodic","last_commit_time":"2019-05-23","tags":"nlopt","name":"nlopt","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"\n    nlopt\n  ","maintainers":"Noda Shintaro","authors":"","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2851,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/slic/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#melodic","last_commit_time":"2019-05-23","tags":"slic","name":"slic","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"SLIC-Superpizel ROS Wrapper\n  This file contains the class elements of the class Slic.

It transforms the Gazebo feedback to\n     the \"tactile_data\" topic to provide the same tactile sensor interface as\n     the schunk_sdh package.\n\n     The following parameters can be set:\n     * cells_x: The number of patches on the tactile sensor in the direction\n                perpendicular to the finger. Defaults to 6.\n     * cells_y: The number of patches on the tactile sensor along the direction\n                of the finger. Defaults to 14.\n     * output_range: The maximum output value of one patch. Defaults to 3500.\n     * sensitivity: The change of output in one patch per Newton. Defaults to\n                    350. The sensitivity can be approximated by the following\n                    formula: S = output_range / (measurement_range * cell_area)\n                    - The measurement range of the tactile pads is 250 kPa (from\n                      the data sheet).\n                    - The output range can be determined by experiment from the\n                      real SDH. It is about 3500.\n                    - The cell area is the size of one patch. Length and width\n                      of the area are determined by dividing the length/width\n                      of the collision surface by the number of cells in the\n                      respective direction.\n                      Important: In most cases this is NOT the cell area that is\n                                 given in the data sheet!\n     * filter_length: The length of the moving average filter which smoothes\n                      the values from simulation. Defaults to 10.\n\n     The node subscribes to the following topics to receive data from the\n     simulation:\n     * thumb_2/state\n     * thumb_3/state\n     * finger_12/state\n     * finger_13/state\n     * finger_22/state\n     * finger_23/state\n\n     The node publishes the processed data on the following topic:\n     * tactile_data\n\n     The simulated bumper must obtain the collision data in the link that the\n     sensor is attached to.
