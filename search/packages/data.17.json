package of hector_worldmodel. It listens to percept message from\n     detectors (e.g. heat signatures of persons or recognitions of other objects of interest in the\n     scene) and fuses all information to a single worldmodel state. Objects will be tracked over time\n     and their states can be influenced by a couple of services.\n\n     The percept to object association problem is solved either automatically based on the Mahalanobis\n     distance, or a unique object_id can be given in the percept message.\n\n     If a hector_nav_msgs/GetDistanceToObstacle service is available, the object_tracker can optionally\n     deduce the depth of objects in the scene by projection to the nearest obstacle (wall).","maintainers":"Johannes Meyer","authors":"Johannes Meyer","distro":"hydro","instance":"github-tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg-hector_worldmodel","readme":""},{"id":2460,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/hector_worldmodel/github-tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg-hector_worldmodel#hydro","last_commit_time":"2016-06-24","tags":"hector worldmodel","name":"hector_worldmodel","repo_name":"hector_worldmodel","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.4","description":"\n    The hector_worldmodel stack helps to collect and fuse information about objects in the world.\n    It is used by Team Hector Darmstadt to localize victims and QR codes in the Robocup Rescue\n    scenario.
