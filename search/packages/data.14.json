not totally clear what the state of this package is with respect\n    to the upstream repository.\n    It is, however, approximately the one merged in

provides the CMake quirks that allows releasing SOEM as a ROS package.\n\n    All bug reports regarding the original SOEM source code should go to the bugtracker at\n
