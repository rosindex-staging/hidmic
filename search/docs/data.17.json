For ardent use MSVC 2015 64-bit.\nAfter that, the default settings are fine.\nFinally, set the Qt5_DIR environment variable in the cmd.exe where you intend to build so that CMake can find it:\n> set Qt5_DIR=C:\\Qt\\5.10.0\\msvc2017_64\n: You could set it permanently with ``setx -m Qt5_DIR C:\\Qt\\5.10.0\\msvc2017_64`` instead, but that requires Administrator.\n\n\nNote, this path might change based on which MSVC version you’re using or if you installed it to a different directory.\n\nRQt dependencies¶\n> pip install -U pydot PyQt5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting the Source Code¶\nNow that we have the development tools we can get the ROS 2 source code.\nFirst setup a development folder, I use C:\\dev\\ros2:\n> md \\dev\\ros2\\src\n> cd \\dev\\ros2\n\n\nGet the ros2.repos file which defines the repositories to clone from:\n# CMD\n> curl -sk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/release-latest/ros2.repos -o ros2.repos\n\n# PowerShell\n> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/release-latest/ros2.repos -o ros2.repos\n\n\n\nNote: if you want to get all of the latest bug fixes then you can try the “tip” of development by replacing release-latest in the URL above with master. The release-latest is preferred by default because it goes through more rigorous testing on release than changes to master do. See also Maintaining a Source Checkout.\n\nNext you can use vcs to import the repositories listed in the ros2.repos file:\n# CMD\n> vcs import src < ros2.repos\n\n# PowerShell\n> vcs import --input ros2.repos src\n\n\n\n\nGetting a DDS Vendor¶\nYou’ll also need a DDS Vendor available for ROS to build against.\nThere is currently support for eProsima FastRTPS, Adlink’s OpenSplice, and RTI’s Connext DDS.\nThe source distribution of ROS 2 includes FastRTPS, so it will always build unless explicitly ignored.\n\nAdlink OpenSplice¶\nIf you would like to also build against OpenSplice, you will need to first download the latest version of OpenSplice.\nThen run something like the following command before building ROS 2, to set up the OpenSplice environment:\ncall \"C:\\opensplice69\\HDE\\x86_64.win64\\release.bat\"\n\n\nwhere the exact paths may need to be slightly altered depending on where you selected to install OpenSplice.\n\n\nRTI Connext 5.3¶\nIf you would like to also build against RTI Connext, you will need to first visit the RTI website and obtain a license (evaluation or purchased) for RTI Connext DDS as well as the installer via their downloads page.\nAfter installing, use the RTI Launcher to load your license file.\nThen before building ROS 2, set up the Connext environment:\ncall \"C:\\Program Files\\rti_connext_dds-5.3.1\\resource\\scripts\\rtisetenv_x64Win64VS2017.bat\"\n\n\nNote that this path might need to be slightly altered depending on where you selected to install RTI Connext DDS.\nThe path above is the current default path as of version 5.3.1, but will change as the version numbers increment in the future.\nIf you want to install the Connext DDS-Security plugins please refer to this page.\nIf you don’t install any additional DDS vendors, ROS 2 will default to using eProsima’s Fast-RTPS as the middleware.\n\n\n\nBuilding the ROS 2 Code¶\nTo build ROS 2 you will need a Visual Studio Command Prompt (usually titled “x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017” for bouncy and later or “x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2015” for ardent and earlier) running as Administrator.\nFastRTPS is bundled with the ROS 2 source and will always be built unless you put an AMENT_IGNORE file in the src\\eProsima folder.\nTo build the \\dev\\ros2 folder tree:\n> colcon build --merge-install\n\n\nNote, we’re using --merge-install here to avoid a PATH variable that is too long at the end of the build. If you’re adapting these instructions to build a smaller workspace then you might be able to use the default behavior which is isolated install, i.e. where each package is installed to a different folder.\nNote, if you are doing a debug build use python_d path\\to\\colcon_executable colcon.\nSee Extra stuff for debug mode for more info on running Python code in debug builds on Windows.\n\n\nTesting and Running¶\nNote that the first time you run any executable you will have to allow access to the network through a Windows Firewall popup.\nYou can run the tests using this command:\n> colcon test\n\n\nAfterwards you can get a summary of the tests using this command:\n> colcon test-result\n\n\nTo run the examples, first open a clean new cmd.exe and set up the workspace.\nThis is done by sourcing the local_setup.bat file, which will automatically set up the environment for any DDS vendors that support was built for.\nThen execute the examples, e.g.:\n> call install\\local_setup.bat\n> ros2 run demo_nodes_py talker\n\n\nIn a separate shell you can do the same, but instead run the listener:\n> call install\\local_setup.bat\n> ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener\n\n\nFor more explanations see the Python Programming demo or other tutorials.\nNote: it is not recommended to build in the same cmd prompt that you’ve sourced the local_setup.bat.\n\n\nAlternative DDS Sources¶\nThe demos will attempt to build against any detected DDS vendor.\nThe only bundled vendor is eProsima’s Fast RTPS, which is included in the default set of sources for ROS 2.\nTo build for other vendors, make sure that your chosen DDS vendor(s) are exposed in your environment when you run the build.\nIf you would like to change which vendor is being used see: Working with Multiple RMW Implementations\n\n\nTroubleshooting¶\n\nCMake error setting modification time¶\nIf you run into the CMake error file INSTALL cannot set modification time on ... when installing files it is likely that an anti virus software or Windows Defender are interfering with the build. E.g. for Windows Defender you can list the workspace location to be excluded to prevent it from scanning those files.\n\n\n260 Character Path Limit¶\nThe input line is too long.\nThe syntax of the command is incorrect.\n\n\nYou may see path length limit errors when building your own libraries, or maybe even in this guide as ROS2 matures.\nRun regedit.exe, navigate to Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\FileSystem, and set LongPathsEnabled to 0x00000001 (1).\nHit the windows key and type Edit Group Policy. Navigate to Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Filesystem. Right click Enable Win32 long paths, click Edit. In the dialog, select Enabled and click OK.\nClose and open your terminal to reset the environment and try building again.\n\n\nCMake Packages Unable to Find asio, tinyxml2, tinyxml, eigen, or log4cxx¶\nWe’ve seen, but been unable to identify the root cause, that sometimes the chocolatey packages for asio, tinyxml2, etc. do not add important registry entries and that will cause CMake to be unable to find them when building ROS 2.\nIt seems that uninstalling the chocolatey packages (with -n if the uninstall fails the first time) and then reinstalling them will fix the issue.\n\n\npatch.exe Opens a New Command Window and Asks for Administrator¶\nThis will also cause the build of packages which need to use patch to fail, even you allow it to use administrator rights.\nThe solution, for now, is to make sure you’re building in a Visual Studio command prompt which has been run as administrator. On some machines canceling the prompt without selecting “Yes” will also work.\n\n\n\nExtra stuff for Debug mode¶\nIf you want to be able to run all the tests in Debug mode, you’ll need to install a few more things:\n\nTo be able to extract the Python source tarball, you can use PeaZip:\n\n> choco install -y peazip\n\n\n\nYou’ll also need SVN, since some of the Python source-build dependencies are checked out via SVN:\n\n> choco install -y svn hg\n\n\n\nYou’ll need to quit and restart the command prompt after installing the above.\nGet and extract the Python 3.7.3 source from the tgz:\n\nhttps://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/Python-3.7.3.tgz\nTo keep these instructions concise, please extract it to C:\\dev\\Python-3.7.3\n\n\nNow, build the Python source in debug mode from a Visual Studio command prompt:\n\n> cd C:\\dev\\Python-3.7.3\\PCbuild\n> get_externals.bat\n> build.bat -p x64 -d\n\n\n\nFinally, copy the build products into the Python37 installation directories, next to the Release-mode Python executable and DLL’s:\n\n> cd C:\\dev\\Python-3.7.3\\PCbuild\\amd64\n> copy python_d.exe C:\\Python37 /Y\n> copy python37_d.dll C:\\Python37 /Y\n> copy python3_d.dll C:\\Python37 /Y\n> copy python37_d.lib C:\\Python37\\libs /Y\n> copy python3_d.lib C:\\Python37\\libs /Y\n> for %I in (*_d.pyd) do copy %I C:\\Python37\\DLLs /Y\n\n\n\nNow, from a fresh command prompt, make sure that python_d works:\n\n> python_d\n> import _ctypes\n\n\n\nTo create executables python scripts(.exe), python_d should be used to invoke colcon\n\n> python_d path\\to\\colcon_executable build\n\n\n\nHooray, you’re done!\n\n\nSROS2 Debug Mode¶\nIn order to use SROS2 in Debug mode on Windows, a corresponding debug build for lxml must be installed.\n\nA pre-built Python wheel binary for lxml debug is provided, to install:\n\n> pip install https://github.com/ros2/ros2/releases/download/lxml-archives/lxml-4.3.2-cp37-cp37dm-win_amd64.whl\n\n\n\nTo verify installation\n\n> python_d\n> from lxml import etree\n\n\n\nNo import errors should appear.\nNote, in order to switch back to release, reinstall the release wheel of lxml via pip:\n\n> pip install lxml\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"id":86,"url":"/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Actions/Creating-an-Action/","title":"Creating an Action","content":"\nCreating an Action¶\nIn this tutorial we look how to define an action in a ROS package.\nMake sure you have satisfied all prequisites.\n\nDefining an Action¶\nJust like in ROS 1, actions are defined in .action files of the form:\n# Request\n---\n# Result\n---\n# Feedback\n\n\nAn action definition is made up of three message definitions separated by ---.\nAn instance of an action is typically referred to as a goal.\nA request message is sent from an action client to an action server initiating a new goal.\nA result message is sent from an action server to an action client when a goal is done.\nFeedback messages are periodically sent from an action server to an action client with updates about a goal.\nSay we want to define a new action “Fibonacci” for computing the Fibonacci sequence.\nFirst, create a directory action in our ROS package.\nWith your favorite editor, add the file action/Fibonacci.action with the following content:\nint32 order\n---\nint32[] sequence\n---\nint32[] partial_sequence\n\n\nThe goal request is the order of the Fibonacci sequence we want to compute, the result is the final sequence, and the feedback is the partial_sequence computed so far.\n\n\nBuilding an Action¶\nBefore we can use the new Fibonacci action type in our code, we must pass the definition to the rosidl code generation pipeline.\nThis is accomplished by adding the following lines to our CMakeLists.txt:\nfind_package(action_msgs REQUIRED)\nfind_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)\n\nrosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}\n  \"action/Fibonacci.action\"\n  DEPENDENCIES action_msgs\n)\n\n\nWe should also add the required dependencies to our package.xml:\n<buildtool_depend>rosidl_default_generators</buildtool_depend>\n\n<depend>action_msgs</depend>\n\n<member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>\n\n\nNote, we need to depend on action_msgs since action definitions include additional metadata (e.g. goal IDs).\nWe should now be able to build the package containing the “Fibonacci” action definition:\n# Change to the root of the workspace (ie. action_ws)\ncd ../..\n# Build\ncolcon build\n\n\nWe’re done!\nBy convention, action types will be prefixed by their package name and the word action.\nSo when we want to refer to our new action, it will have the full name action_tutorials/action/Fibonacci.\nWe can check that our action built successfully with the command line tool:\n# Source our workspace\n# On Windows: call install/setup.bat\n. install/setup.bash\n# Check that our action definition exists\nros2 action show action_tutorials/Fibonacci\n\n\nYou should see the Fibonacci action definition printed to the screen.\n\n\n"},{"id":87,"url":"/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/Install-Connext-Security-Plugins/","title":"Installing Connext security plugins","content":"\nInstalling Connext security
