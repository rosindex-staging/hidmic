First choose ‘Custom installation’:\n\nNext check Visual C++:\n\nEnsure that the correct features will be installed:\n\n\nB. Install Visual Studio 2017 if using Bouncy or a nightly\n\nIf you already have a paid version of Visual Studio 2017 (Professional, Enterprise), skip this step.\n\n\nWarning\nVisual Studio 2017 v15.8 seems to have a compiler bug preventing from building some ROS 2 packages. Please try installing an older version of Visual Studio 2017.\nMicrosoft provides a free of charge version of Visual Studio 2017, named Community, which can be used to build applications that use ROS 2:\nhttps://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/\nMake sure that the Visual C++ features are installed.\nAn easy way to make sure they’re installed is to select the Desktop development with C++ workflow during the install.\n\n\n\n\nInstall additional DDS implementations (optional)¶\nROS 2 builds on top of DDS.\nIt is compatible with multiple DDS or RTPS (the DDS wire protocol) vendors.\nThe package you downloaded has been built with optional support for multiple vendors: eProsima FastRTPS, Adlink OpenSplice, and (as of ROS 2 Bouncy) RTI Connext as the middleware options.\nRun-time support for eProsima’s Fast RTPS is included bundled by default.\nIf you would like to use one of the other vendors you will need to install their software separately.\n\nAdlink OpenSplice¶\nIf you want to use OpenSplice, you will need to download the latest supported version.\n* For ROS 2 Crystal version 6.9.181126OSS-HDE-x86_64.win-vs2017 or later is required.\n* For ROS 2 Bouncy version 6.7.180404OSS-HDE-x86_64.win-vs2017 or later is required.\nDownload the latest supported version\nFor ROS 2 releases up to and including Ardent, extract it but do not do anything else at this point.\nFor ROS 2 releases later than Ardent, set the OSPL_HOME environment variable to the unpacked directory that contains the release.bat script.\n\n\nRTI Connext¶\nTo use RTI Connext (available as of ROS 2 Bouncy) you will need to have obtained a license from RTI.\nYou can install the Windows package of Connext version 5.3.1 provided by RTI from their downloads page.\nAfter installing, run RTI launcher and point it to your license file.\nSet the NDDSHOME environment variable:\nset \"NDDSHOME=C:\\Program Files\\rti_connext_dds-5.3.1\"\n\n\nIf you want to install the Connext DDS-Security plugins please refer to this page.\n\n\n\nInstall OpenCV¶\nSome of the examples require OpenCV to be installed.\nYou can download a precompiled version of OpenCV 3.4.1 from https://github.com/ros2/ros2/releases/download/opencv-archives/opencv-3.4.1-vc15.VS2017.zip\nAssuming you unpacked it to C:\\opencv, type the following on a Command Prompt (requires Admin privileges):\nsetx -m OpenCV_DIR C:\\opencv\n\n\nSince you are using a precompiled ROS version, we have to tell it where to find the OpenCV libraries. You have to extend the PATH variable to c:\\opencv\\x64\\vc15\\bin\n\nIn ardent and earlier¶\nThese releases used OpenCV 2. You can download a precompiled version of OpenCV 2.4.13.2 from https://github.com/ros2/ros2/releases/download/release-beta2/opencv-2.4.13.2-vc14.VS2015.zip\nSince you are using a precompiled ROS version, we have to tell it where to find the OpenCV libraries. Assuming you were extracting OpenCV to c:\\ you have to extend the PATH variable to c:\\opencv-2.4.13.2-vc14.VS2015\\x64\\vc14\\bin\n\n\n\nInstall dependencies¶\nThere are a few dependencies not available in the Chocolatey package database. In order to ease the manual installation process, we provide the necessary Chocolatey packages.\nAs some chocolatey packages rely on it, we start by installing CMake\n> choco install -y cmake\n\n\nYou will need to append the CMake bin folder C:\\Program Files\\CMake\\bin to the PATH (you can do this by clicking the Windows icon, typing “Environment Variables”, then clicking on “Edit the system environment variables”.\nIn the resulting dialog, click “Environment Variables”, the click “Path” on the bottom pane, then click “Edit” and add the path).\nPlease download these packages from this GitHub repository.\n\nasio.1.12.1.nupkg\neigen-3.3.4.nupkg\ntinyxml-usestl.2.6.2.nupkg\ntinyxml2.6.0.0.nupkg\n\nOnce these packages are downloaded, open an administrative shell and execute the following command:\n> choco install -y -s <PATH\\TO\\DOWNLOADS\\> asio eigen tinyxml-usestl tinyxml2\n\n\nPlease replace <PATH\\TO\\DOWNLOADS> with the folder you downloaded the packages to.\nYou must also install some python dependencies for command-line tools:\npython -m pip install -U catkin_pkg empy git+https://github.com/lark-parser/lark.git@0.7d opencv-python pyparsing pyyaml setuptools\n\n\n\nRQt dependencies¶\npython -m pip install -U pydot PyQt5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloading ROS 2¶\n\nGo the releases page: https://github.com/ros2/ros2/releases\nDownload the latest package for Windows, e.g., ros2-package-windows-AMD64.zip.\n\nNotes:\n\nthere may be more than one binary download option which might cause the file name to differ.\n[ROS Bouncy only] To download the ROS 2 debug libraries you’ll need to download ros2-bouncy-windows-Debug-AMD64.zip\n\n\n\n\nUnpack the zip file somewhere (we’ll assume C:\\dev\\ros2).\n\nNote (Ardent and earlier): There seems to be an issue where extracting the zip file with 7zip causes RViz to crash on startup. Extract the zip file using the Windows explorer to prevent this.\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up the ROS 2 environment¶\nStart a command shell and source the ROS 2 setup file to set up the workspace:\n> call C:\\dev\\ros2\\local_setup.bat\n\n\nFor ROS 2 releases up to and including Ardent, if you downloaded a release with OpenSplice support you must additionally source the OpenSplice setup file manually (this is done automatically for ROS 2 releases later than Ardent; this step can be skipped).\nIt is normal that the previous command, if nothing else went wrong, outputs “The system cannot find the path specified.” exactly once.\nOnly do this step after you have sourced the ROS 2 setup file:\n> call \"C:\\opensplice69\\HDE\\x86_64.win64\\release.bat\"\n\n\n\n\nTry some examples¶\nIn a command shell, set up the ROS 2 environment as described above and then run a talker:\n> ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker\n\n\nStart another command shell and run a listener:\n> ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener\n\n\nYou should see the talker saying that it’s Publishing messages and the listener saying I heard those messages.\nHooray!\nIf you have installed support for an optional vendor, see this page for details on how to use that vendor.\n\nTroubleshooting¶\n\nIf at one point your example would not start because of missing dll’s, please verify that all libraries from external dependencies such as OpenCV are located inside your PATH variable.\nIf you forget to call the local_setup.bat file from your terminal, the demo programs will most likely crash immediately.\n\n\n\n\n"},{"id":43,"url":"/doc/ros2/Installation/Linux-Install-Debians/","title":"Installing ROS2 via Debian Packages","content":"\nInstalling ROS2 via Debian Packages¶\n\nTable of Contents\n\nResources\nSetup Locale\nSetup Sources\nInstall ROS 2 packages\nEnvironment setup\n\n(optional) Install argcomplete\nSourcing the setup script\n\n\nInstall additional RMW implementations\nInstall additional packages using ROS 1 packages\n\n\nDebian packages for ROS 2 Bouncy (the latest release) are available for Ubuntu Bionic; packages for ROS 2 Ardent are available for Ubuntu Xenial.\n\nResources¶\n\nStatus Pages:\n\nROS 2 Crystal (Ubuntu Bionic): amd64, arm64\nROS 2 Bouncy (Ubuntu Bionic): amd64, arm64\nROS 2 Ardent (Ubuntu Xenial): amd64, arm64\n\n\nJenkins Instance\nRepositories\n\n\n\nSetup Locale¶\nMake sure you have a locale which supports UTF-8.\nIf you are in a minimal environment, such as a docker container, the locale may be something minimal like POSIX.\nWe test with the following settings.\nIt should be fine if you’re using a different UTF-8 supported locale.\nsudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8\nsudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8\nexport LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n\n\n\n\nSetup Sources¶\nTo install the Debian packages you will need to add our Debian repository to your apt sources.\nFirst you will need to authorize our gpg key with apt like this:\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg2 lsb-release\ncurl http://repo.ros2.org/repos.key | sudo apt-key add -\n\n\nAnd then add the repository to your sources list:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb [arch=amd64,arm64] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2-latest.list'\n\n\n\n\nInstall ROS 2 packages¶\nFirst set an environment variable for the ROS 2 release you want to install so it can be used in other commands.\nexport CHOOSE_ROS_DISTRO=crystal  # or bouncy or ardent\nsudo apt update\n\n\nDesktop Install (Recommended): ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials.\nsudo apt install ros-$CHOOSE_ROS_DISTRO-desktop\n\n\nROS-Base Install (Bare Bones): Communication libraries, message packages, command line tools.
